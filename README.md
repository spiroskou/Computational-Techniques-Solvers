# Computational-Techniques-Solvers
This project is about the implementation of computational algorithms on large linear systems in order to significantly reduce the computational cost.
For example, in Finite Element Analysis, we have to deal with large matrices who are sparse. In order to avoid saving the full matrix on the computer memory, we choose to store only parts of it and perform the calculations needed on a reduced linear system.
